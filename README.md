# ACE Moral Weights
This includes Monte-Carlo simulations to estimate the welfare range variances across models and species for the moral weight project.

If you want to test the model with your own parameters, run "run.py" and follow the instructions in your terminal. The simulations take about 4 minutes to complete. Then run "sentience_models.ipynb" and then "wr_models.ipynb" to calculate the probabilities of sentience and welfare ranges and on pre-generated simulation data.

If you don't want to change the parameters, run "sentience_models.ipynb" and then "wr_models.ipynb" to calculate the probabilities of sentience and welfare ranges and on pre-generated simulation data.

Then, run 'category_moral_weights.ipynb' to generate the moral weights for all categories of interest.
